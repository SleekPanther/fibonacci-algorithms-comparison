# Fibonacci Algorithms Runtime Comparison
Comparison between runtimes of a **recursive** implementation & a **memoized array** approach storing calculated values in an array to avoid recalculation.

F[0]=0  
F[1]=1  
F[i]=F[i-1]+F[i-2]

## Runtimes
Runtime output is saved in a file. [View `runtimes.txt` for my sample runtimes](runtimes.txt)
